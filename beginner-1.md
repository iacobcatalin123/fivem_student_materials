> To get started with Lua programming for FiveM, you will need to download and install the FiveM client and server, as well as a code editor such as Visual Studio Code. You can then create a new resource in the resources folder of your FiveM server and start writing Lua code.

> In the next steps of your learning journey, you will need to explore Lua syntax, data types, variables, functions, and tables, as well as the FiveM API (Application Programming Interface) which provides a set of functions and events that can be used to interact with the game engine and other resources. You can then start building simple resources and gradually move on to more complex ones as you gain experience and knowledge.

## Data Types: 
1. nil (`nil`) - represents the absence of a value. It is often used to indicate that a variable has no value.

2. boolean (`true/false`) - represents the logical values true and false.

3. number (`0,1,2,3`)- represents numeric values. Lua uses double-precision floating-point numbers to represent all numeric values.

4. string (`"hello"`)- represents text or character data. Strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes.

5. table (`{"data", 0, {}, nothing=nil}`) - represents a collection of key-value pairs. Tables can be used to represent arrays, dictionaries, objects, and other complex data structures.

6. function (`function add(a,b) return a+b end  `) - represents a block of code that can be called multiple times. Functions can be used to encapsulate reusable code and improve code modularity.

7. userdata (`not used in fivem`) - represents values that are created and managed by the application or the C/C++ code that Lua is embedded in.

8. thread (`CreateThread()`) - represents an independent thread of execution. Threads can be used to run multiple tasks concurrently and improve program performance.

## Variables
> In Lua, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They can hold values of any of the data types discussed earlier. Variables in Lua are dynamic, meaning that they do not have a fixed type and can hold values of any type.

> To create a variable in Lua, you simply need to specify its name and assign a value to it. For example, to create a variable called "myVariable" and assign it the value of 10, you can use the following code:

```lua
myVariable = 10
```
> In Lua, variables can also be assigned nil to indicate that they have no value. To assign a nil value to a variable, you can use the following code:

```lua
myVariable = nil
```
> Lua also provides a way to declare variables explicitly using the local keyword. When you declare a variable using local, it is only visible within its scope. For example, the following code creates a local variable called "myLocalVariable" and assigns it the value of 5:

```lua
local myLocalVariable = 5
```
> It's important to note that in Lua, variables are case-sensitive, meaning that "myVariable" and "myvariable" are treated as two different variables. Additionally, variable names can contain letters, digits, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or underscore.

## Functions
>Functions in Lua are blocks of code that can be called from other parts of a program. They can take arguments (or parameters) as input and return one or more values as output. In Lua, functions are first-class values, which means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions.

```lua
function add(a, b)
  return a + b
end
```

> In the example above, the function is defined using the keyword `function`, followed by the function name, and then the arguments in parentheses. The body of the function is enclosed in a block of code, which performs the computation and returns the result using the `return` keyword.

> To call the function and use its return value, you can use the function name followed by the arguments in parentheses:
```lua
result = add(2, 3)
print(result) -- Output: 5
```
> In Lua, functions can also be defined as anonymous functions or closures, which are functions that have access to variables in their enclosing scope. This allows for more flexible and powerful programming constructs.

> Functions in Lua are a powerful tool for structuring and organizing code, and they are widely used in Lua programming. It's important to understand how to define, call, and use functions effectively in Lua to write efficient and maintainable code.

## Tables

>Tables are a versatile and powerful data structure in Lua. They can be used to represent arrays, dictionaries, objects, and other complex data structures. In Lua, tables are used to implement associative arrays, which are arrays indexed not only with numbers but also with other values, such as strings or other tables.

>To create a new table in Lua, you can use the {} notation. For example, the following code creates an empty table:

```lua
myTable = {}
```

> To add elements to a table, you can use the square bracket notation (`[]`). For example, the following code creates a table with three elements:

```lua
myTable = { "apple", "banana", "orange" }
```

> You can also add elements to a table using the table.insert function. For example, the following code adds the element "pear" to the end of the table:

```lua
table.insert(myTable, "pear")
```
> Tables in Lua can also have keys and values. Keys can be any value except `nil`, and values can be any type, including other tables. For example, the following code creates a table with keys and values:

```lua
myTable = { ["name"] = "John", ["age"] = 30, ["address"] = { ["street"] = "Main Street", ["city"] = "New York" } }
```

> To access elements in a table, you can use the square bracket notation with the index or key of the element. For example, the following code accesses the first element of the table:
```lua
print(myTable[1]) -- Output: apple
```

> Tables in Lua are a powerful tool for organizing and manipulating data. They are used extensively in Lua programming and are a key feature of the language. It's important to understand how to create, add to, and access elements in tables to write efficient and maintainable Lua code.
